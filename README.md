# 🚲 Bike Sharing Demand Prediction - Capstone Project

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict bike rental demand in a city based on historical usage patterns, weather data, and temporal features.

## 📌 Objective

To predict the number of bike rentals required in a given hour using supervised learning techniques. The goal is to help bike-sharing companies optimize bike distribution and improve customer satisfaction.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset) or Kaggle.  
It includes hourly data of bike rentals along with features such as:

- `datetime`: Timestamp of data record
- `season`: Season (1:spring, 2:summer, 3:fall, 4:winter)
- `holiday`: Whether the day is a holiday
- `workingday`: If the day is neither weekend nor holiday
- `weather`: Weather situation
- `temp`, `atemp`: Temperature and "feels like" temperature
- `humidity`, `windspeed`: Environmental conditions
- `casual`, `registered`: Breakdown of users
- `count`: Total rentals (target variable)

---

## 📈 Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature extraction from datetime
   - Encoding categorical variables

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Distribution plots
   - Trend analysis by hour, season, etc.

3. **Model Building**
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor
   - XGBoost (optional)

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - R² Score

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV

---

## 📊 Results

The best model achieved an RMSE of `xx.xx` and R² score of `0.xx`.  
Feature importance showed that `hour`, `temperature`, and `workingday` were key predictors.
